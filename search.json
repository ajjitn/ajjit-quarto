    "text": "At the end of June 2024, Posit released a beta version of its next-generation IDE for data science: Positron. This follows Positâ€™s general vision for language-agnostic data analysis software: RStudio PBC renamed itself to Posit PBC in 2022 to help move away from a pure R focus, and Quarto is pan-lingual successor to R Markdown. Having the name of the main programming language in the title of things is outâ€”providing more general tools is in.\nPositron is essentially a specialized version of Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio Code, and is a fork of the underlying Code - OSS that powers VS Code. Iâ€™m super excited about thisâ€”in my own work, I use RStudio for most things R-related and VS Code for everything else (Stan, Python, HTML, CSS, Lua, LaTeX, Typst, etc.). VS Code is phenomenal and I love using it. Itâ€™s the best way to edit files on a remote server. Itâ€™s the best way to interact with Docker containers and Docker Compose. GitHub Copilot Chat is fantastic.\nBut for me, itâ€™s never quite been a replacement for RStudio. Every couple months, I play around with trying to use VS Code for R work full time, but the constellation of VS Code R extensions (like the R extension and Radian for the terminal) and general R support has never been what I want, and I always end up going back to RStudio. Which is fine! I adore RStudio too and have been using it since it first came out in beta in February 2011 (13 years!).\nPositron brings pretty much all the little R-related things that I love from RStudio and have missed in Visual Studio Code. The regular collection of VS Codeâ€™s R extensions and add-ons is no longer necessary, since Posit has created a custom R kernelâ€”Arkâ€”for any text editor or IDE with Jupyter support. Itâ€™s still a beta product and a little rough around the edges, but Iâ€™ve found that it really is the perfect blend of the best parts of RStudio and VS Code.\nBelow, following the example of Marc Dotson and Christopher Kenny, I want to highlight some of the neat new things Positron can do and share some of the settings, extensions, and other customizations Iâ€™ve been using for the past couple weeks.\n\nSome cool new things"
