    "text": "In August of 2024, I went to my first ever Posit Conf in Seattle (as a sidenote, Seattle has probably the best summer weather of any American city and if I could ever afford a summer house I would buy one there). I saw some friends present their amazing data projects, I met lots of interesting new folks, and saw lots of presentations on Quarto. And that experience motivated me to do something I’ve wanted to do for a while - make my own personal website with Quarto!\nI started by looking at what other people had done and was particularly struck by how elegant but low maintenance Andrew Heiss’s Quarto website was. And thanks to him making his code open source, I was able to quickly and shamelessly fork his code to jumpstart my own website creation. To make my plagiariasm slightly less transparent, I made a few edits outlined below:\n\n\nFirst, I adjusted some of the fonts and colors to match my personal preferences. One helpful tool I use to choose complementary colors is coolors.co which automatically suggests complementary, nice, and colorblind friendly palettes. This involved changing the html/website.scss file that contains the CSS styles. Thankfully quarto theming files use SASS, a variant/extension of CSS that supports easy variable creation, default styles, and other features. You define new variables at the top of the file with:\n//\n// Color system\n//\n$white:    #ffffff !default;\n$orange:  #EE6A24 !default;\n$light-orange:  #FB9E07 !default;\n$dark-green:   #003E1F !default;\n$light-green: #659B5E !default;\nAnd you use them later on in the stylesheet like this:\n// Navbar\n$navbar-bg: $dark-green !default;\n$navbar-fg: $white !default;\n$navbar-hl: $light-orange !default;\nIn the above chunk, $navbar-bg is a builtin SASS variable which you can manually specify for the background color of the navbar. You can also use the color variables inside a traditional CSS selector like:\n.navbar-title {\n  background-color: $dark-green; /* Dark background for contrast */\n  color: $white; /* White text for readability */\n}\nFor a full list of the builtin SASS variables you can easily change and more info on theming, see this Quarto docs page.\n\n\n\nI could render the website on my local machine before pushing to Github Pages. But I’m lazy, and wanted to use the power of Github Actions to automaticaly render in case I forgot. I walked away feeling energized and wanting to tackle a new QUa\nAt the end of June 2024, Posit released a beta version of its next-generation IDE for data science: Positron. This follows Posit’s general vision for language-agnostic data analysis software: RStudio PBC renamed itself to Posit PBC in 2022 to help move away from a pure R focus, and Quarto is pan-lingual successor to R Markdown. Having the name of the main programming language in the title of things is out—providing more general tools is in.\nPositron is essentially a specialized version of Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code, and is a fork of the underlying Code - OSS that powers VS Code. I’m super excited about this—in my own work, I use RStudio for most things R-related and VS Code for everything else (Stan, Python, HTML, CSS, Lua, LaTeX, Typst, etc.). VS Code is phenomenal and I love using it. It’s the best way to edit files on a remote server. It’s the best way to interact with Docker containers and Docker Compose. GitHub Copilot Chat is fantastic.\nBut for me, it’s never quite been a replacement for RStudio. Every couple months, I play around with trying to use VS Code for R work full time, but the constellation of VS Code R extensions (like the R extension and Radian for the terminal) and general R support has never been what I want, and I always end up going back to RStudio. Which is fine! I adore RStudio too and have been using it since it first came out in beta in February 2011 (13 years!).\nPositron brings pretty much all the little R-related things that I love from RStudio and have missed in Visual Studio Code. The regular collection of VS Code’s R extensions and add-ons is no longer necessary, since Posit has created a custom R kernel—Ark—for any text editor or IDE with Jupyter support. It’s still a beta product and a little rough around the edges, but I’ve found that it really is the perfect blend of the best parts of RStudio and VS Code.\nBelow, following the example of Marc Dotson and Christopher Kenny, I want to highlight some of the neat new things Positron can do and share some of the settings, extensions, and other customizations I’ve been using for the past couple weeks."
