    "text": "In August of 2024, I went to my first ever Posit Conf in Seattle (as a sidenote, Seattle has probably the best summer weather of any American city and more people should know about it). I saw some friends present their amazing data projects, met lots of interesting new people, and saw lots of presentations on Quarto. And that experience motivated me to do something I’ve wanted to do for a while - make my own personal website with Quarto!\nI started by looking at what other people had done and was particularly struck by how elegant but low maintenance Andrew Heiss’s Quarto website was. And thanks to him making his code open source, I was able to quickly and shamelessly fork his code to jumpstart my own website creation. To make my plagiariasm slightly less transparent, I made a few edits outlined below:\n\n\nFirst, I adjusted some of the fonts and colors to match my personal preferences. One helpful tool I use to choose complementary colors is coolors.co which automatically suggests complementary, nice, and colorblind friendly palettes. This involved changing the html/website.scss file that contains the CSS styles. Thankfully quarto theming files use SASS, a variant/extension of CSS that supports easy variable creation, default styles, and other features. You define new variables at the top of the file with:\n//\n// Color system\n//\n$white:    #ffffff !default;\n$orange:  #EE6A24 !default;\n$light-orange:  #FB9E07 !default;\n$dark-green:   #003E1F !default;\n$light-green: #659B5E !default;\nAnd you use them later on in the stylesheet like this:\n// Navbar\n$navbar-bg: $dark-green !default;\n$navbar-fg: $white !default;\n$navbar-hl: $light-orange !default;\nIn the above chunk, $navbar-bg is a builtin SASS variable which you can manually specify for the background color of the navbar. You can also use the color variables inside a traditional CSS selector like:\n.navbar-title {\n  background-color: $dark-green; /* Dark background for contrast */\n  color: $white; /* White text for readability */\n}\nFor a full list of the builtin SASS variables you can easily change and more info on theming, see this Quarto docs page.\n\n\n\nThere are also handy functions to lighten() or darken() colors in SASS which I use frequently and make CSS color management so much easier! No more wondering about which light green goes with your dark green color.\nSCSS also makes use of nesting to allow you to group related CSS rules within a hierarchical structure that mimics the actual content of your HTML page. I find that this makes complex CSS pages so much more readable. As an example of both tips above, here’s how I lighten the orange colored CV download button on my website on hover:\n.cv-download {\n    font-family: $headings-font-family;\n    background-color: $orange;\n    border-color: $orange;\n    color: $white;\n\n    &:hover {\n        background-color: lighten($color: $orange, $amount: 10);\n        color: $white;\n    }\n}\nThe &:hover {...} is also handy SCSS syntax which allows me to specify more specific CSS rules when the cv-download class button is hovered over. For those of us that have had the (mis)forture of doing this with raw CSS, this approach is a lot cleaner and much easier.\n\n\n\nOne other feature I added to Andrew’s website template was adding a Github Action to automatically render and deploy my website to Github Pages whenever I push to Github. To do so, I mostly followed the instructions on this helpful Quarto documentation page on deployments. One key change I had to make"

I’m on a funded fellowship through the Federation for American Scientists to build data and technology capacity within government.\nIn my current role I help create data and tools to investigate housing discrimination, build dashboards for policy-makers, and advise on long term IT/Data infrastructure needs. I love all things open source, mapping, and GIS!\nI got my Masters in Geographic Data Science from the London School of Economics in 2023, and a Bachelor’s in Urban Studies and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019.
